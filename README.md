# Hate Speech Detection 🔍

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a piece of text contains hate speech, offensive language, or neither.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook:  
📁 `hate speech detection.ipynb`

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization and vectorization
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and accuracy metrics
- Real-time prediction examples


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hate-speech-detection.git
cd hate-speech-detection

2. Install dependencies:
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook
